# Introduction

This Ubercart module provides an easy method to integrate with the payment gateway.
 - The plugin directory contains the files that need to be uploaded to the root of your Ubercart installation
 - Supports Drupal versions: **8.0+**

# Prerequisites

- The module requires the following prerequisites to be met in order to function correctly:
    - The 'bcmath' php extension module: https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php

> Please note that we can only offer support for the module itself. While every effort has been made to ensure the payment module is complete and bug free, we cannot guarantee normal functionality if unsupported changes are made.

# Rebranding

All Ubercart settings can be configured in the admin pages and thus this module is unbranded by default. When downloading as a zip file, you can right-click and rename to remove the `Unbranded` text from the filename.

# Installing and configuring the module

1. Unzip and upload the plugin folder to your root directory
2. Activate the module 'Payment Network' through the 'Extend' menu in Drupal
3. Go to Store -> Payment methods -> and find 'ADD PAYMENT METHOD' section
4. Find Payment Network Hosted Integration from the select box, and add it
5. Configure settings to complete the process of adding payment method
6. Click 'Save'
